# CF-Better-Auth Executive Overview

## Project Summary

CF-Better-Auth is a comprehensive, framework-agnostic authentication and authorization system for TypeScript applications. Built as a powerful self-hosted open-source solution, it provides enterprise-grade security with complete customization capabilities, designed to be YOUR authentication system, not a third-party service.

## Key Differentiators vs Commercial Alternatives

### Cost Structure
- **CF-Better-Auth**: Free forever, unlimited users, self-hosted
- **Commercial Alternatives**: Monthly fees per user, usage-based pricing, vendor lock-in

### Control & Customization
- **Complete White-Labeling**: Full branding control through environment variables
  - Custom application name (`APP_NAME`)
  - Custom logos and branding (`APP_LOGO_URL`)
  - Configurable color schemes (`APP_PRIMARY_COLOR`)
  - All user-facing text customizable
  - Deploy under your own domain

### Technical Advantages
| Feature | CF-Better-Auth | Commercial Solutions |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Self-Hosting** | ✅ Full control over infrastructure | ❌ Limited or cloud-only |
| **Database Control** | ✅ Your database, your rules | ❌ Managed/locked databases |
| **Customization** | ✅ Complete (code, UI, features) | ❌ Limited customization options |
| **TypeScript** | ✅ First-class TypeScript support | Varies by provider |
| **Data Sovereignty** | ✅ Complete data ownership | ❌ Limited data control |
| **Passkeys/WebAuthn** | ✅ Full support included | Often enterprise-tier only |
| **Multi-tenancy** | ✅ Plugin-based architecture | Varies by pricing tier |
| **Feature Toggle** | ✅ Runtime configuration | ❌ Usually static |
| **Open Source** | ✅ MIT License | ❌ Proprietary |
